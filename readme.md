## A fully functional project to create a sales report overview with data cleaning in T-SQL and data visualisation in a Power BI dashboard

This aim of this project was to create a visual dashboard and improved Sales reporting or follow up for sales force for the following user stories:
* What are the sales vs budget across time?
* How much are the internet sales per customer? Who are the biggest customers?
* How much are the internet sales per product? Which products sell the most?
* What is the overview of sales by city and product category?

The [AdventureWorks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms) data file was extracted from the SQL Server for this project. 

T-SQL was used to clean and transform the data, retaining only relevant columns, renaming them, joining relevant columns into the tables and ordering them.

Power BI was used to create an interactive dashboard containing all the relevant user stories for the purpose of the project.
